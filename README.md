# Spectral Extraction From Multiple Regions in FITS File

Spectral Extraction From Multiple Region in FITS File

The provided code conducts data processing and visualization tasks with astronomical data, involving reading FITS files, analyzing spectral regions, and fitting Gaussian models. Specifically, it helps to extract spectra C+, 12CO, and 13CO from the selected regions (average (big box) spectrum and 14 positions (or cirles) on NGC 7538. Later on, the code attempt to fits line profile with 3-Gaussian line profile. These are plots from Kavak et al. in preparation.
